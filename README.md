# Number-Guessing

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in PowerShell. The game allows users to choose a difficulty level, make guesses, and keeps track of their attempts. At the end of the game, user statistics are saved to a file for future reference and ranking.

## How to Play
1. Select a Difficulty:
   - When the game starts, you are prompted to choose between three difficulty levels:
       - Easy: Guess a number between 1 and 100.
       - Medium: Guess a number between 1 and 10,000.
       - Hard: Guess a number between 1 and 1,000,000.
2. Make Your Guesses:
   - After selecting a difficulty, you will begin making guesses. The game will provide feedback:
       - If your guess is too low, you will be prompted to guess a higher number.
       - If your guess is too high, you will be prompted to guess a lower number.
       - Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
3. User Information:
   - After guessing the correct number, the game will prompt you to enter a username.
   - It will display how many guesses it took to find the number.
4. Leaderboard:
   - The game stores each playerâ€™s score and attempts in a text file, named according to the selected difficulty level:
       - numberGuessRankingListEASY.txt
       - numberGuessRankingListMEDIUM.txt
       - numberGuessRankingListHARD.txt
   - The leaderboard stores the following information:
       - Username
       - Number to guess
       - Number of guesses
       - Difficulty

## Features
- Multiple Difficulty Levels: Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard modes to suit your challenge preference.
